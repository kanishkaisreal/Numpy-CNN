Run Train_cnn.py that will train on MNISt data and save the trianed weights. 
Then run test_cnn.py that reads the trained weights and then gives the prediction. 
I made a test_sr_v1.py for superesolution (can't recall if it runs but it's a modification of test_cnn.py)
Run the test_sr_v1.py for testing.
